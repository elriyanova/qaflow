Iâ€™ve been in the software testing industry for over 5 years. I completed my graduation in Software and administration of information systems and then started my career as a Software QA Engineer. I was passionate about this field right from the beginning and decided to start this blog qaflow.dev to share my knowledge and experience with everyone.

Hope you like it and find this page useful! I have always had a passion for writing and have been using it as a tool for self-expression and reflection. 

I believe that by sharing our stories and perspectives, we can learn from one another and grow together :)
